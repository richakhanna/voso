Presented Voso at Sequoia Hackathon 2016, a video search app that looks inside the videos for better search 
&amp; discovery. Say bye to video captions.

In this current version,
We have built the app which searches for gif based on the content/frames of gif & not using meta-data or title while
searching.

Two features in the app:                                                                                                      
1. The app takes the voice command & show gif based on input.                                                                  
2. Using similar button, you can discover similar gifs.
